# Password Generator
!link to website here!
## Description

My goal for this project was to create an application that will generate a random password given the user input of length and character type. I really put my knowledge of JavaScript to the test to create this page and learned a lot more about what I need to focus my attention on in JavaScript. 

## Usage

To begin generating a new, random password, simply click the 'Generate Password' button and follow the prompts given until a lovely new password appears available for you to copy.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
